# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

You must provide a backend API base URL for the app to work.  
In your `.env` file (located at the root of `notes_frontend`), set:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=<your backend API base URL, e.g. "http://localhost:8000/api">
```

The app expects REST endpoints for:

- `POST   /auth/login`   `{ email, password }`   – receive `{ token }`
- `POST   /auth/signup`  `{ email, password }`   – receive `{ token }`
- `GET    /notes`        (with Bearer token)      – receive `{ notes: [...] }`
- `POST   /notes`        `{ title, content }`     – receive `{ note }`
- `PUT    /notes/:id`    `{ title, content }`
- `DELETE /notes/:id`

### Running and Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
